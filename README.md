# Programming Projects

Hello! I keep all of the random small, learning projects that I do in various 
programming languages here. Python, C, Powershell, and Bash mostly. Some random 
forays into other languages are likely. All of which I will keep here.

No project here is particularly _good_ in a broad sense, but all have been useful 
as I continue to develop as a basic programmer. I am not trying to become a 
developer, but rather functional enough to code my own tools to fit the task at hand.

Hopefully, you might find something useful here, or at least something to spark
and idea of your own.
