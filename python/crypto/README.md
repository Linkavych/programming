# Encryption Routines - Python

A series of simple python scripts to encrypt a provided file using a 
specific algorithm. Done for the purpose of better understanding how the
algorithm is implemented in code, how it works in reality, and general coding practice.

Intent is to replicate this practice in both C and Rust.
