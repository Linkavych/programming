# Project 5 - Living on the Land
 
 Scenario: You successfully delivered a phishing payload and now have access to
 a machine inside your target's environment. It appears that your user is pretty
 locked down and you can't seem to get some of your tools to run on the machine.
 Luckily for you, Python is installed on the machine and can be used in place of
 your normal toolkit.

## Beginner Task

Write a script to perform a ping sweep of a range of IP Addresses, and port scan any host that responds.

## Intermediate task

Add "smart" functionality. Only port scan alive hosts. Allow the user to only scan
the NMAP top 10, 100, 1000 ports.

## Advanced Task

Add some additional service enumeration based on open ports. Pick three different 
services and add some enumeration functionality of your choosing.
