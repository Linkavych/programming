# Project 4 - Pilfer for passwords

## Scenario

While working with you teammates at Red Planet on an internal penetration test, you found lots of files spread across open SMB shares. Using another tool you have downloaded these files to your local machine. Now you need to find out if these files contain any sensitive data!

## Beginner 

Write a script that will search file names for files that could contain sensitive information. Names such as web.config, passwords.txt, SiteList.xml, etc.

## Intermediate 

Add functionality to the script that will enable it to search the contents of files for strings containing sensitive information like "password" "username", "apikey", etc.

## Expert

Allow the user to specify the combinations of file names, types, and strings to search for. 

## Bonus

Add recursive search.
