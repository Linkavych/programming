# Project 6 - Scrape or Die!

## Scenario: 

You're struggling to get external access and your spraying attempts with common password combinations are failing. A colleague at Red Planet suggested looking at the company website for common keywords that you can use to build more paswords to spray from. But that sure is an awful lot of work to do by hand.

## Beginner Task: 

Scrape all the text from a website and dump all of the words into a list. Be sure to de-duplicate whatever you find.

## Intermediate Task: 

Add crawling to the scraper funtionality to follow links to other pages within the same domain.

## Advanced Task: 

Count the number of times certain words appear and filter out common words like "it, the, is, and, etc". Have it sort the list with the number of times each word appears.

## Bonus Task: 

Can you turn your list into common password combinations? Such as Capitalizing the First Letter, Adding an "!" to the end, adding common number combinations. Replacing certain letters wit leet speak. A = 4 E = 3 T = 7 - etc.
