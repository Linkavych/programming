# Project 1 - The Scope

## Scenario

Congrats! Your penetration testing company Red Planet has landed an external assessment for Microsoft!
Your point of contact has given you a few IP addresses to test. Like with any test, you should always
verify the scope given to you to make sure there wasn't a mistake.

### Beginner Task

Write a script that will have the user input an IP address. The script should output the ownership
and geolocation of the IP. The output should be presented in a way that is clean and organized for use
in a report.

### Intermediate Task

Have the script read multiple IP addresses from a text file and process them all at once.

### Expert Task

Have the script read from a file containing both single IP addresses and CIDR notation. Process both.
