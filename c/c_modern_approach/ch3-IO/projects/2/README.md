# Project 2.2

Write a program that formats product information entered by the user.
A session with the program should look like: 

```text

Enter item number: 583
Enter unit price: 13.5
Enter purchase date (mm/dd/yyyy): 10/24/2010

ITEM					UNIT					PURCHASE
							PRICE					DATE
583						$  13.50			10/24/2010
```

The item number and date should be left justified; unit price should be
right justified. Allow dolars amounts up to $9999.99.
