# Project 4.1

Write a program that asks the user to input a two-digit number, then prints
the number with the digits reversed. A session with the program should
have the following appearance:

```text
Enter a two-digit number: 28
The reverse is: 82
```
Read the numbers using %d, then break into two digits.
