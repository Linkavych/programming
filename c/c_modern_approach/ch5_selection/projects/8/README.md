Following table shows the daily flights from one city to another:

0800						1016
0943						1152
1119						1331
1247		 				1500
1400						1608
1545						1755
1900						2120
2145						2358

Write a program that asks users to enter a time (expressed in hours and 
minutes, using the 24-hour clock). The program then displays the departure
and arrival times for the flight whose departure time is closest to that
entered by the user.
