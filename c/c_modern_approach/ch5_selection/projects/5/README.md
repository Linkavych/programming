In one state, single residents are subject to the following income tax:

INCOME						Amount of TAX
<= 750						1% of income
> 750 < 2250			7.50 + 2% of amount over 750
> 2250 < 3750			37.50 + 3% of amount over 2250
> 3750 < 5250			82.50 + 4% of amount over 3750
> 5250 < 7000			142.50 + 5% of amount over 5250
> 7000						230.00 + 6% of amount over 7000

, then displays the tax due.
