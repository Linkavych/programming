# Project 5-3

Modify the broker.c program by making both of the following changes:

1. Ask the user to enter the number of shares and price per share.
2. Add statements that comput the commission charged by a rival broker
($33 plus 3 cents per share for fewer than 2000 shares; $33 plus 2 cents per share for 2000+ shares). 
Display the rival's commission as well as the commission charged by 
original broker.
